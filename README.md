# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

By using machine learning and neural networks, we worked to help Beks create a binary classifier to predict if an applicant will successfully be funded by Alphabet Soup. We worked with a vast dataset of over 34,000 organizations which we processed the data we were provided. We proceeded to compile, train and evaluate the model using TensorFlow. As the results we got were under the 75% threshhold we were looking for, we tried 3 different ways to optimize our model further to get us over the 75% mark.
